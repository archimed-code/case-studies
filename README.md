# Product Owner Case Study

## Introduction

Imagine that you have joined as a Product Owner for a CRM Platform in an investment firm. During one of the routine catch-up meetings, you found that one of the major objectives of this CRM platform is to track the user activity (that is, how does a specific user interacts with the platform so that active users may be rewarded) along with deal progression (that is, how does a specific company moves from the first stage where it just enters the scope of investment to a more advanced stage where it is thoroughly analysed and finally the stage when it is conisdered for investment). Now, users are entering information in the CRM about deals as part of their routine interaction with the tool but only a few are doing it actively. 

## Objective
1. Part 1: Based on the information acquired from the aforementioned introduction, you are required to come with a solution and build something which can make the users interact more freqently and actively with the CRM platform and overall improve the entire experience smoother for both the users and the managers of users who are going to track their activity? Think from both an indiviudal user's and coresponding manager's perspectives. In an ideal solution we would expect an explanation of how you would like to approach this problem and eventually solve it. Further, your solutions must accompany user flow diagram(s) and any wireframes & prototypes as you deem necessary.



2. Part 2: Now, let us assume that you have got this feature built with the suport of your tech and operations team. Explain how would you go about the launch plan of the specific product. In an ideal solution, we would expect an explanation of your launch process and strategy for this feature and a written solution in the form of a blog post (you may use markdown or any other format you desire to communicate) in around 300 words to be shared with your corresponding audience.
