# Product Owner Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome!

Imagine that you have joined as a Product Owner for a CRM Platform in an investment firm. During one of the routine catch-up meetings, you found that one of the major objectives of this CRM platform is to track the user activity (that is, how does a specific user interacts with the platform so that active users may be rewarded) along with deal progression (that is, how does a specific company moves from the first stage where it just enters the scope of investment to a more advanced stage where it is thoroughly analysed and finally the stage when it is conisdered for investment). Now, users are entering information in the CRM about deals as part of their routine interaction with the tool but only a few are doing it actively. 

## Objective
1. Part 1: Based on the information acquired from the aforementioned introduction, you are required to come with a solution and build something which can make the users interact more freqently and actively with the CRM platform and overall improve the entire experience for both the users and the managers of users who are going to track their activity. Think from both an indiviudal user's and coresponding manager's perspectives while attempting to solve this proble and make necessary assumptions. In an ideal solution we would expect an explanation of how you would like to approach this problem and eventually solve it. Further, your solutions must accompany user flow diagram(s) and any wireframes & prototypes as you deem necessary.


2. Part 2: Now, let us assume that you have got this feature built with the suport of your tech and operations team. Explain how would you go about the launch plan of the specific product. In an ideal solution, we would expect an explanation of your launch process and strategy for this feature and a written solution in the form of a blog post (you may use markdown or any other format you desire to communicate) in around 300 words to be shared with your corresponding audience.

## Deliverables
First, prepare a report as a document or a presentation with the following sections well detailed-
- Assumptions : Feel free to talk about any particular approach you wuld like to take to arrive at your assumptions, say your own experience or some specific customer research strategy.
- Value propositions
- Objective(s)
- Approach/ Solution: Remember that while writing the approach, explain clearly how exactly you are validating the problem and using what assumptions/ hypothesis and data to do so. 
- Pain-points of the current users / user goals (Hypothesis): All the hypothesis considered must be backed by the data or assumptions and you must specify relevant metrics to track them. Further, we would expect your opinions about how to validate the hypothesis after the product launch. 
- Possible feature recommendations/ improvements
- Probable high-value features: While describing the features, do not forget to talk about how to prioritise them while also breaking them down into tasks and measuring their significance in terms of impact, effort, urgency and priority.
- Preferred core features for building MVP

Second, prepare a report discussing the launch strategy and an article in around 300 words with relevant images or explanations. further, provide necesary KPIs to be used as part of the launch strategy for measuring product success and use a data driven approach to create a forecast aboutt he KPIs to demonstrate the real world scenario making any assumptions as you consider necessary but it must be well explained.

We are sure that you will surprise us with your creativity and out of the box thinking. Remember that there are no specific answers to the aforesiad questions and therefore it is important to enjoy this exercise and approach it with your own vision with as much freedom as possible. We wish you all the best and in case of any questions, feel free to reach out to us for clarity!
